Frontend Boilerplate
===================


The purpose of this boilerplate is to follow some good practices and to get started quickly on a frontend project. The boilerplate is at a early stage and still requires collaboration with the backend so that it could be used in a variety of situations. If what you are doing is only a static frontend then this would be ideal for you.

```
yarn install
gulp

You will be able to view your page on `http://localhost:3000/` also notice that an `app` directory is created each time you change a file in the `src` directory. The `app` directory is the production build of your page!
